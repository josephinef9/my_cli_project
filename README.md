# 15 Coffees To Try Before You Die

# Objectives
- Use Nokogiri to scrape a website titled "15 Coffees To Try Before You Die".
- Use scraped data to create a CLI where the user can see a list of those 15 coffees.
- Give user an option to select one of the coffees and get information about the coffee they selected.
- Give user an option to choose another coffee after they are done learning about the previous one.

# Overview
This project will scrape the 15 Coffees To Try Before You Die webpage. When the CLI starts, it will welcome the user and give them a list of the 15 different types of coffee. Once the user enters a number from 1 to 15, it will return the corresponding coffee and give the user more information about it, which will include its bio, ingredients and instructions. Once the user is done reading about the coffee they selected, they will have the option to either pick another coffee or exit the program. If they choose to exit the program, the CLI will output a goodbye message.
